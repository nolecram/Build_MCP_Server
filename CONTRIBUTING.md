## Making Changes

### Code Style

# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Run linting
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new features in `tests/`
- Use `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`
- Follow the existing test structure
- Aim for >80% code coverage

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=playwright_mcp_server tests/

# Specific test
pytest tests/test_tools.py::TestPlaywrightTools::test_navigate
```
